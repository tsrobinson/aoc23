# Advent of Code 2023

My attempts at the AoC 2023.

## Progress/reflections

- Day 1: pleased I worked out that you can iterate once and check both ends, but level of nesting is a bit gross.
- Day 2: part 1 is straightforward using regex, part 2 is cool as you can use a look ahead
- Day 3: part 1 was relatively straightforward, part 2 I struggled with as decided to search for asterisks rather than use the existing search of numbers. Eventually looked at subreddit, where I got the idea to store + update list of gears based on number searches. Indexing the window proved finicky, but solved in the end!
- Day 4: relatively simple, using lookbehind/aheads to separate lists of numbers. In Part 2 I managed to simplify updating the cards, noting that it's not really as sequential as I first thought.
